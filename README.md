### Description
Momotaro is a japanese fairytale which tells the story of a child, Momotaro, born from a magical peach. His village was haunted by orcs: he leaves his parents and with the help of a pheasant, a dog and a monkey, he eventually defeates the orcs.

The original plot has been divided into several scenes, each illustrated by a 3D render.

In every scene, there's a choice to be taken that eventually brings to a different ending. **The user then, navigating from scene to scene, changes the plot**. Inside the story there are three videogames to overcome in order to get to the end.

Videogames are coded with JavaScript/Phaser.io, 3D illustrations are made with 3DsMax.
